# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The first iteration of the What to Wear server. This server is in developmental stages that will allow users and items to be added to the server.

## Code Structure

This Server has been created with extensive error handling to allow for easy debugging. Code has also been seperated into schemas, routes and controllers for a more refined file organization.

<!-- ### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12 -->
